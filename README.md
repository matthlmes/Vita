# Vita

2nd year web development project "Vita". 

Created by Sonica group consisting of Matthew Holmes, Stuart Keith and William Drummond.

Webpage consists of:
  - Landing Page, where users can see what the website is all about and sign-up / log-in
  - Dashboard, where news is sourced via an API and shown alongside other user posts
  - Weather Page, where the MET office API is called to get the current weather forecast
  - Chat Page, where users can chat with one another
  - Profile Pages, Where users can view their posts or others posts and follow other users

The website was hosted using codio.
